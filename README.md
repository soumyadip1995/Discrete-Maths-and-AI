The Aim of this repo is not how to show you the all the traditional methods that are included in discrete mathematics. But we will be dealing with a problem or to be more specific a murder mystery which we will be solving using  discrete mathematics along with the various methodologies available with AI .

#### We are going to take a ride with Bob who is a detective of the Police department in New York City and has been assigned with the duty of  determining a killer within a limited timeframe. The only resources available at his disposal are discrete mathematics and Artificial Intelligence.

## Usage

`gtfs-graph` requires Node.js version 7.2.1.

After cloning the repository, be sure to install the necessary dependencies.

`npm install`

There is an `npm` command to build the JavaScript bundle and start the Node.js server. These are not joined because the combine sequence takes longer than 60 seconds to complete, with is Heroku's limit on server boot time. See Other for the component commands.

`npm run all`

### Test

A test suite of mostly unit tests is included. To run the tests:

`npm test`

### Other

To build the JavaScript bundle without starting the server, run:

`npm run build-js`

Then, the Node.js server may be started.

`npm start`

### Advanced Usage

Command-line options are available for `lib/server/index.js` to customize a run.

`--system` will load the server for only a single specified system. Default: all.

`node lib/server/index.js --system MBTA`

`--verbosity` will run the server at the specified verbosity. Default: info.

`node lib/server/index.js --verbosity verbose`
